# FrontEnd
This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). Iâ€™ll be uploading daily updates, code snippets, and progress logs as I work through various aspects of the stack. The repo serves as a personal log of my development process, challenges, solutions, and incremental learning.
